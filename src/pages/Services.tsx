            <span className="services-header">Remedial Massage</span>
            <div className="text-content">
                Unlike a routine-based relaxation massage, remedial massage is all about remedying conditions of the soft tissue. 
                A session can include just about any type of treatment method, whatever works, to address your specific needs. 
                Areas treated, technique and pressure are all customised for the individual.
                Remedial massage can be useful for just about all aches & pains of muscle and soft tissue, 
                for anyone from office workers to tradies, fitness enthusiasts to professional athletes.

            <span className="services-header">Traditional Thai Massage</span>
            <div className="text-content">
                I learned it the traditional way; performed on a mat at floor level, fully dressed, 
                no lotions or creams. This is what I did for three years, before studying remedial massage. 
                I still enjoy practicing this way, and I do incorporate many Thai techniques
                into my remedial massage work. 
                The techniques and theory of Thai massage are comparable with modern anatomical understanding.

            <span className="services-header">Myofascial Cupping</span>
            <div className="text-content">
            This involves plastic or glass cups being placed on the body and attached by means of suction-induced vacuum. 
            There are a number of methods, including leaving them stationary, gliding over an area of the body or having the client 
            move the affected area with the cups in place. All these methods work by opening space between the skin, fascia and muscles, 
            allowing fresh blood into the area.
            </div>
            <span className="services-header">Dry Needling</span>
            <div className="text-content">
                A method of precisely targeting a trigger point or other sore area. 
                This involves inserting acupuncture-type needles into the muscles, 
                to really get to those tight and sore places. Unlike acupuncture however, 
                dry needling is used only for soft tissue (i.e. muscle and connective tissue) conditions.
            </div>
            <span className="services-header">Posture and Movement</span>
            <div className="text-content">
                It never ceases to amaze me, just how much chronic pain is caused by less-than-ideal posture and movement habits 
                in daily life. Treatment sessions usually include an assessment of posture or a particular range of movement, 
                as well as detailed discussions about your work day, hobbies and activities or athletic pursuits. 
                Depending on the outcome, I can give corrections or exercises to get you standing and moving comfortably.

            <span className="services-header">Pregnancy</span>
            <div className="text-content">
            While pregnancy can be a natural and wonderful experience, it is very demanding on the body. 
            Massage can alleviate much of the discomfort during this time. 
            I have experience treating women in all stages, from first trimester to full term.
